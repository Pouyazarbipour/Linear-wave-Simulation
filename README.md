# Linear Wave Simulation GUI

Linear Wave Simulation is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) for simulating linear waves. The simulation allows users to input wave parameters (height, period, and depth), calculate the corresponding wavelength, and visualize the wave's motion over time. The GUI also includes a "Stop" button to halt the simulation. This tool is designed for researchers, students, and engineers interested in coastal and marine applications.

## Features
- **Wave Simulation**: Simulates linear waves based on user input for wave height, period, and local depth.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays a plot of the wave motion that updates in real time.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input values are positive and within reasonable limits (e.g., wave height is adjusted if it exceeds 80% of the depth).
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can adjust parameters and start/stop the simulation via the GUI.

## Requirements
- MATLAB (R2017b or newer recommended)
- MATLAB's GUI components (e.g., `uifigure`, `uieditfield`, `uibutton`, `uiaxes`)
